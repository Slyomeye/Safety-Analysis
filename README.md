# Safety-Analysis-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project in Excel, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning and data visualization.

## Project Objective											
The data is aimed at providing insights and recommendations to improve a safe working environment, reduce hazards and costs. By analyzing the data, informed decisions are made

## Data Used
-<a href= "https://github.com/Slyomeye/Safety-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Safety%20Dataset.xlsx">Dataset</a> 

## Questions (KPIs)
 Compare the incident costs of the previous years with the recent year 
 How many days were lost due to incidence
 Which department had more incident cost
 Most incident type that occurred to staff
 Which age group had the most incident cost
 Which work shift had the most incident cost

## Process
Verified data for any missing values and anomalies
Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
Created pivot tables according to questions asked.
Merged all pivot tables into one dashboard and applied slicer to make it dynamic.

## Project Insight
The total incident cost for the present year reduced compared to previous years.
The number of days lost was also minimized. The adult age group (25-34) had more incident costs compared to other age groups.
Florida had the most incident cost in the present year compared to the previous year.
The maintenance department had the most incident cost in the present year compared to previous year.
The most incident type was fall/trip and has maintained a high amount which is a worrying issue that needs to be corrected.

## Conclusion
To further reduce costs at all the plants, Safety meetings should be conducted on regular basis. The most occuring incident (fall/trip) should be addressed and taken very seriously, Rules and measures regarding wet grounds should be made. Orienting of both old and new staff regularly on importance of safety. Adequate Personal Protective Equipments (PPE) should be made available and given to workers for use. Strict measures regarding safety should be taken regarding safety tools, work environment and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and defaulters not complying to these measures should be penalized.
