# Safety-Analysis-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project in Excel, creating multiple dashboards and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, including data preprocessing, data cleaning and data visualization.

## Project Objective											
The data is aimed at providing insights and recommendations to improve a safe working environment, reduce hazards and costs. By analyzing the data, informed decisions are made

## Data Used
-<a href= "https://github.com/Slyomeye/Safety-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/Safety%20Dataset.xlsx">Dataset</a> 

## Questions (KPIs)
 Compare the incident costs of the previous years with the recent year 
 How many days were lost due to incidence
 Which department had more incident cost
 Most incident type that occurred to staff
 Which age group had the most incident cost
 Which work shift had the most incident cost

## Process
Verified data for any missing values and anomalies
Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
Created pivot tables according to questions asked.
Merged all pivot tables into one dashboard and applied slicer to make it dynamic.
